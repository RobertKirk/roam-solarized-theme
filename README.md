# Roam Research Solarized Themes

This repo contains a Solarized light and dark theme. Feel free to fork and edit them if you wish. They don't change much functionality/placement - just colouring and some spacing.

`theme-light.css` is the light theme and `theme-dark.css` is the dark theme. I use [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) to apply my themes (I use the light one).
